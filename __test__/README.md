# Regression tests #

We follow the regression tests for
[satysfi-base](https://github.com/nyuichi/satysfi-base/tree/master/__test__). [SATySFi](https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi)
and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) are required, but
diff-pdf is not needed because this package does not provide
typesetting commands.
